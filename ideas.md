  **Design Movement**: Organic Modernism
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Nature-First Authenticity**: Every element should feel grounded in the earth, reflecting the farm-to-table journey.
  2. **Clean & Trustworthy**: Use structure and clarity to convey professional reliability and hygiene.
  3. **Vibrant Freshness**: Visuals should pop with the vitality of fresh produce and healthy livestock.
  4. **Community Connection**: Emphasize the human element and local impact through warm, inviting layouts.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Deep Forest Green (#1B4D3E) - representing stability, growth, and the lush farmland of Sierra Leone.
  - **Secondary**: Sunny Yolk Yellow (#F4B400) - evoking the freshness of eggs and the warmth of the sun.
  - **Accent**: Earthy Soil Brown (#5D4037) - grounding the design in the agricultural reality.
  - **Background**: Soft Cream/Off-White (#FAF9F6) - providing a clean, organic canvas that isn't sterile like pure white.
  - *Reasoning*: This palette directly mirrors the product (eggs, crops) and the environment, creating an immediate subconscious link to freshness and nature.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Organic Flow**: Move away from rigid block grids. Use curved section dividers that mimic rolling hills or egg shapes.
  - **Overlapping Elements**: Images and text boxes will slightly overlap to create depth and connection, symbolizing the integrated ecosystem of the farm.
  - **Full-Width Immersion**: Hero sections and key visual breaks will span the full width to immerse the user in the "farm" experience.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Hand-Drawn Iconography**: Custom, sketch-style icons for "fresh," "local," and "sustainable" to add a human touch.
  - **Texture Overlays**: Subtle grain or paper textures on background sections to avoid a "plastic" digital feel.
  - **Curved Image Masks**: Photos cropped in organic shapes (circles, soft-cornered rectangles) rather than sharp squares.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Gentle Growth**: Hover effects that "grow" or "bloom" (slight scale up, soft shadow increase) rather than sharp color changes.
  - **Smooth Scroll**: A seamless, gliding scrolling experience that feels like walking through a field.

  **Animation**:
  - **Parallax Backgrounds**: Slow-moving background elements (leaves, abstract hill shapes) to create depth.
  - **Fade-Up Entry**: Content should gently rise into place as the user scrolls, like crops growing.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Recroleta* or a similar soft-serif font. It feels friendly, organic, and premium.
  - **Body**: *Satoshi* or *Plus Jakarta Sans*. Clean, geometric sans-serif for high readability and modern professionalism.
  - **Hierarchy**: Large, welcoming headlines paired with spacious, easy-to-read body text.

  **Design Movement**: Industrial Agritech
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Precision & Efficiency**: Highlight the modern, biosecure, and professional aspects of the farm operations.
  2. **Transparency**: Use clear, grid-based layouts to present data and information openly.
  3. **Bold Impact**: High contrast and strong typography to assert market leadership.
  4. **Future-Forward**: Position Diro Agro as a pioneer in sustainable agriculture technology.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Tech Green (#00A86B) - a brighter, more digital shade of green symbolizing innovation.
  - **Secondary**: Slate Black (#1A1A1A) - for strong contrast, sophistication, and modernity.
  - **Accent**: Alert Orange (#FF6B35) - for calls to action, drawing attention to freshness and urgency.
  - **Background**: White (#FFFFFF) with Light Grey (#F3F4F6) sections - clean, clinical, and efficient.
  - *Reasoning*: This palette speaks to the "science" of agriculture—hygiene, logistics, and modern standards.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: A strict, card-based layout that organizes information into digestible "crates" or "modules."
  - **Split-Screen Heroes**: Half image, half text for immediate information delivery.
  - **Data Visualization Focus**: Use stats and numbers as key visual elements (e.g., "100% Natural," "8 Hectares").

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Geometric Patterns**: Hexagons (chicken wire/honeycomb) or linear field patterns as background motifs.
  - **High-Contrast Borders**: Thick, defined borders on cards and buttons.
  - **Technical Diagrams**: stylized illustrations of the process or farm layout.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snappy Feedback**: Instant, sharp transitions on hover and click.
  - **Sticky Navigation**: A robust navigation bar that stays with the user for quick access to "Order" or "Contact."

  **Animation**:
  - **Slide-In Reveals**: Content slides in from the sides with mechanical precision.
  - **Counter Animations**: Numbers rolling up (e.g., counting up to 100% satisfaction).

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Oswald* or *Teko*. Tall, condensed sans-serifs that feel industrial and impactful.
  - **Body**: *Roboto* or *Inter*. Neutral, highly legible, and standard.
  - **Hierarchy**: Very distinct weight differences—Extra Bold for titles, Regular for text.

  **Design Movement**: Rustic Warmth
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Home & Hearth**: Evoke the feeling of a family kitchen and traditional farming values.
  2. **Tactile Richness**: Focus on the textures of nature—wood, burlap, eggshells, soil.
  3. **Storytelling**: Guide the user through a narrative journey of the farm's origin and mission.
  4. **Community Heart**: Center the design around people—farmers, families, and customers.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Olive Green (#556B2F) - a muted, natural green that feels aged and authentic.
  - **Secondary**: Terracotta (#E2725B) - representing the earth and clay.
  - **Accent**: Golden Wheat (#F5DEB3) - a soft, warm highlight color.
  - **Background**: Warm Beige/Paper (#FDFBF7) - easy on the eyes, reading like a storybook or menu.
  - *Reasoning*: This palette is nostalgic and comforting, positioning the brand as a wholesome staple of life.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Single-Column Narrative**: A strong central flow that reads like a letter or article.
  - **Scrapbook Style**: Images placed with "tape" effects or slightly rotated to look like physical photos.
  - **Centered Typography**: Classical centering for headings and key statements to evoke tradition.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Watercolor Washes**: Soft splashes of color behind images or text blocks.
  - **Serif Accents**: Use of elegant serif fonts for pull quotes and testimonials.
  - **Photography Focus**: High-quality, warm-toned photography of people and products.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Slow & Deliberate**: Transitions that feel leisurely and relaxed.
  - **Paper-like Tactility**: Buttons that depress or fold slightly.

  **Animation**:
  - **Fade-In**: Soft, slow fades for all elements.
  - **Hand-Drawn Lines**: Underlines or circles that animate as if being drawn by a pencil.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Playfair Display* or *Merriweather*. Classic, elegant serifs with high contrast.
  - **Body**: *Lora* or *Source Serif Pro*. Readable serifs that encourage reading.
  - **Hierarchy**: Use of italics and varied tracking to create a sophisticated, editorial look.
